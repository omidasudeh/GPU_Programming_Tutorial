# Chapter 2: CUDA Programming in Practice
[Back to Table of Content](../../Readme.md) | **[Next: Host-Device Heterogeneous Programming Model](2.Host-Device-Model.md)**

In this chapter we focus on CUDA programming in practice, we talk about the host-device heterogeneous programming model and go through details of kernel programming and lunching kernels from host with example code. In Chaper 1 [# Data Parallel Model](../Chapter%201%3A%20CPU%20vs%20GPU%20Architecture%20and%20Performance/5.GPU_Thread_Hierarchy-DataParalellModel.md#L34-L60) we introduced an example of incrementing the values of an array to demonstrate the data-parallel model. In this Chapter we use the same example to demostrate Host-Device heterogeneous programming model. Finally, to reinforce all the new concepts we go through another important example and implement the matrix-matrix multiplication with CUDA.
