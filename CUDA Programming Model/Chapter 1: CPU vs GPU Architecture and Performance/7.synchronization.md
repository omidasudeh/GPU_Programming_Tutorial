## Synchronization in GPU Threads

Threads within a thread block can synchronize using **shared memory** or a synchronization barrier (`_syncthreads`). However, there is no synchronization between threads from different thread blocks.

Each warp has dedicated hardware (registers) for its context, allowing for **1-cycle context switches**. 

Synchronizing threads across thread blocks would require saving the SM's context in global memory, which would negate the benefits of fast context switching.

**Why no Barrier synchronization among thread blocks?**
Barrier synchronization is not permitted between thread blocks because a thread block must complete execution before other thread blocks can be loaded onto an SM. Implementing barrier synchronization across thread blocks would necessitate saving the SM's context to global memory, allowing it to free up resources for loading additional thread blocks. This process would be slow, as once a thread block is loaded, it must continue executing until completion; there is no context switching for thread blocks in this scenario.
