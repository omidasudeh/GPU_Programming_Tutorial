- Threads are organized into a hierarchy:
  - **Grid** of thread blocks of threads
- Threads in the same thread block can cooperate with each other:
  - Share data through **on-chip shared memory**
  - Synchronize using the `__syncthreads` primitive

---

- Threads and thread blocks have **multi-dimensional integer IDs**:
  - Block ID: `blockIdx.x`, `blockIdx.y`, `blockIdx.z` (1D/2D/3D)
  - Thread ID: `threadIdx.x`, `threadIdx.y`, `threadIdx.z` (1D/2D/3D)
  - Block size: `blockDim.x`, `blockDim.y`, `blockDim.z`

---

- Threads in a thread block are grouped into **warps** of 32 threads:
  - Contiguous along `x`, then `y`, then `z`
  - Similar to **linearization** of multi-dimensional arrays
- Each warp executes in **SIMD fashion**:
  - Same instruction in the same clock cycle
