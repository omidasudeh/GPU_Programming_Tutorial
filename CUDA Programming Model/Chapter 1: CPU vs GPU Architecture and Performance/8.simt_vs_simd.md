## SIMT vs SIMD: A Key Difference
[Back to Table of Content](../../Readme.md) | [Previous: Work Division: CPUs vs GPUs](7.work_division.md) | **[Next: Limitations of GPUs](9.limitations_of_gpus.md)**
- **SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)**: Executes a single instruction on multiple data elements in lockstep, with no divergence.
  
- **SIMT (Single Instruction, Multiple Threads)**: Executes a **single instruction across multiple threads**, but **allows divergence** within a group of threads (called a warp). If threads in a warp need to follow different paths, some threads are temporarily disabled (masked) while others complete their execution. The hardware synchronizes the threads when possible.
